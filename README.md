## Introduction
This project is a simple website built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The goal of this project is to practice building a basic website using HTML and understanding how web pages are structured.

By completing this project, I will demonstrate my ability to write semantic HTML, organize files and folders properly, and use Git and GitHub for version control. This project also reinforces good development habits such as writing clear documentation.
